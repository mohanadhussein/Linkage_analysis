# Linkage_analysis
This repo will contain the workflow, datafiles and codes for performing parametric linkage analysis\
Algorithms used in discrete genetic studies requiring pedigree analysis are mostly outdated and if not, they cannot handle large pedigrees. Therefore the approach I am following in my project is to use a recent, maintained tool instead of subdividing the main big family into small branches and analyze them separately. Currently, pedsuite package in R seems like an ideal and powerful alternative. \
The project is still ongoing and is expected to end by June 2024.\
I will be updating the repo with workflow and data as the project progresses.
